This blog is basically and only about [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Ever since I discovered this great programming language, I spent a lot of time studying other people's codes to be able to solve real-life data issues more and more efficiently.

I thought maybe it is time to try to give something back. So I hope you will enjoy the reading!
