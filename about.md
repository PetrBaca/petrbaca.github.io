This blog is basically and only about [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Ever since I discovered R, I have spent a lot of time studying other people's codes to be able to solve real-life data issues more efficiently.

I thought maybe it was time to give something back. Therefore I blog. So I hope you will enjoy the reading!
